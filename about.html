        The Cursed Adventures of hot buff error sans is a joke in a group
        chat with me and a few of my friends, it's not meant to be good,
        I created it to annoy them, the reason I made this website is because
        web development interests me, so i thought this would be a
        good excuse to learn HTML and CSS. And honestly it is pretty fun,
        learning to display this wasnt hard at all, infact it took 30 minutes!
        I would put more time into it, however i have other
        coding related projects, so for now it will be a basic
        website on github.

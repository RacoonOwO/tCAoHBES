        There was once an 18 year old schoolgirl named AFM, she was your average highschooler
        in her last year, ready for it to end. She had a close friend and classmate named Hot Buff Error Sans,
        Error for short. Error skips class often and is 6'4 at age 17. It is currently lunch period, they are
        sitting together as always. AFM, after 2 months, for the hundreth time asked "Why do you skip school so much?
        Youre gonna end up like Tiago!", instead of his usual reponse of "I'm busy", he responded "Im not *that* stupid,
        and if you really wanna know, ill show you after school." AFM looked excited "Really??" "Yeah, I think i can
        share it with you." Error responded. The rest of school went by quickly for AFM knowing that she would finally
        find out the cause of Error's constant skipping. They met at the gate, "Follow me" says Error, as he lead her
        into the forest behind the school. "This is kinda sketchy.." AFM said, worried about where Error is leading her.
        After a few minutes of walking, Error stopped "Were here!", "This is the middle of a forest", AFM replied.
        "Look up", error responded "Woah.." above them, was a massive treehouse connected to several trees,
        it doesn't look finished. Error then said "This is why I've been skipping class, I want to finish this!"
        "Thats amazing, but why did you make it?" AFM asked, "I wanted a special place to hang out with friends,
        or alone. And I'd rather do this than the same test for the 7th week in a row.", Error replied as he started
        walking toward and climbing the ladder, AFM soon followed. "Are you sure this is safe?" AFM asked, worrying Error
        doesn't know what he's doing. "Yup! completely!" he replied, confident in his handywork. "Is this where you stay when
        your parents say youre out?" AFM asked, "Yeah, it's warmer than you'd expect up there", he responded as they finish climbing
        the ladder. "Are you staying here tonight?", AFM questioned "Yeah", he replied "Can i stay here too?" she asked, not wanting
        to deal with her parents tonight. "Of course!" Error responded, excited to spend the night with a friend.
        They hang out and talk all night, eventually AFM gets tired and gets into a sleeping bag, there is a tarp over them to
        prevent rain. Error continued to do work on the treehouse for the last 2 hours, and then he gets into a sleeping bag
        right next to AFM's.
